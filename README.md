# Homework 4: Graph Spectra

### Data Mining (ID2222)
### Authors: Beatrice Ionascu (bionascu@kth.se), Diego Yus Lopez (diegoyl@kth.se)

#### Short description of the solution:

The solution is a Python implementation of the K-eigenvector spectral graph 
clustering algorithm as described in the paper [“On Spectral Clustering: 
Analysis and an algorithm”](http://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/nips01-spectral.pdf)
by Andrew Y. Ng, Michael I. Jordan, Yair Weiss. 


To test and evaluate our implementation, we use the two provided datasets:
 1. [A real graph](https://kth.instructure.com/courses/3688/files/573878) -- This data set was prepared by Ron Burt. 
 He dug out the 1966 [data](http://moreno.ss.uci.edu/data.html#ckm) collected 
 by Coleman, Katz and Menzel on medical innovation, which contains data from 
 physicians in four towns in Illinois: Peoria, Bloomington, Quincy and Galesburg.

 2. [A synthetic graph](https://kth.instructure.com/courses/3688/files/573879)


#### Instructions how to build and run:
The program is a Python 3 jupyter notebook.

To run it type `jupyter notebook` in a terminal window from the project folder.
Then the notebook can be viewed in the browser.

The data used is in the `./data` folder.

#### Results
The results can be found in the notebook and below:
